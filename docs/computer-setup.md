    Getting the tools needed to run Sauder LS, Canvas API projects
    <br />
  </p>
</p>

> üí° The basic setup for working with any Sauder LS Canvas API tools is:
>
> - A tool for getting/updating projects
> - An environment to run it in

[GitHub](https://github.com) is our tool for distributing projects and managing updates. We discuss GitHub in more detail in the next section ([managing projects with GitHub](github-project-management.md)). For now you'll need to:

-  :white_check_mark: [Create a free GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
-  :white_check_mark: _For LS-Ops:_ Contact someone on the Canvas API team to be added to the saud-learning-services/ls-ops team on GitHub (you'll need this to access certain projects)
-  :white_check_mark: [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

> üí° GitHub Desktop isn't necessary if you'd prefer to work in [Terminal](terminal-basics.md) (but make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed)

For managing project environments, we use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). We recommend the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) app for anyone not comfortable working in Terminal.

-  :white_check_mark: [Download Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) _(recommended for most)_
  - select the **64-Bit Graphical Installer** for your operating system. Note that some older Windows computer may need to install the **32-Bit Graphical Installer** (you can check [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d))

Once you have done all the above, you're ready to start downloading and running projects.

We've provided a üë∑ [Setup Test Project](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/setup-test) on our GitHub that you can use throughout the remainder of the documentation to ensure you have everything up and running correctly. We'll provide you with a step-by-step on how to get this project running on your machine, and you can apply this same process to all tools.

Once everything is configured correctly, you should see an output of "Hey {your-name-on-canvas}":
